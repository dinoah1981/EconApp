# Scarcity Simulation - Interaction Design

## Core Interactive Components

### 1. Resource Allocation Simulator
- **Main Game**: Students manage a virtual pizza restaurant with limited ingredients, time, and money
- **Decision Making**: Choose between different ingredient purchases, staffing levels, and menu options
- **Consequences**: Each choice affects profit, customer satisfaction, and available resources
- **Multiple Rounds**: Students see how early decisions impact later options

### 2. Time Management Challenge
- **Scenario**: Students are given 24 hours to complete various activities (homework, sports, social time, sleep)
- **Trade-offs**: Each activity uses time and provides different benefits
- **Scarcity Demonstration**: Students realize they can't do everything and must prioritize
- **Outcome Visualization**: Shows how choices affect grades, health, and happiness

### 3. Budget Constraint Game
- **Scenario**: Students receive a weekly allowance and must decide how to spend it
- **Options**: Food, entertainment, savings, clothes, etc.
- **Limited Resources**: Not enough money to buy everything they want
- **Learning**: Forces students to make choices and understand opportunity cost

### 4. Island Survival Simulation
- **Scenario**: Students are stranded on an island with limited resources
- **Decisions**: How to use time, energy, and materials
- **Trade-offs**: Building shelter vs. finding food vs. making tools
- **Cooperation Option**: Students can work together to share resources

## User Journey
1. **Introduction**: Brief animated explanation of scarcity
2. **Simulation Selection**: Choose from 4 different scenarios
3. **Interactive Gameplay**: Make decisions and see consequences
4. **Reflection**: Guided questions about what they learned
5. **Real-world Connection**: Examples of scarcity in their lives

## Engagement Features
- Visual feedback for all decisions
- Progress tracking across scenarios
- Achievement badges for completing simulations
- Shareable results and insights
- Hint system to guide learning

## Educational Outcomes
Students will understand:
- Why scarcity forces choices
- How opportunity cost works
- The role of economics in society
- Why we can't have everything we want
- How societies organize to meet needs
